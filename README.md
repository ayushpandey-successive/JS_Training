<h1>what is atomic design</h1>
Atomic design is methodology for creating  more coherent, hierarchical, and thoughtful interface design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:

1.Atoms
2.Molecules
3.Organisms
4.Templates
5.Pages


<h2>atoms</h2>
Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

<h2>Molecules</h2>
Molecules are the group of atoms bound together to be the smallest fundamental unit.
A form label, input or button arenâ€™t too useful by themselves, but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something together.

<h2>Organisms</h2>
Molecules give us a fundamental unit or building block. An organism can be formed by combining many molecules. An organism, like a login page or form, is a group of molecules joined together to make intricate individual parts of the design.
Molecules that are similar or different can make up an organism. A website for instance, could have a variety of elements, including a search form, social media channel list, principal navigation, and logo. 

<h2>Templates</h2>
During the template phase, we move into a language that is more meaningful to our clients and to our final product. Templates are typically composed of groups of organisms that are stitched together to create pages. This is the phase where we begin to see the design in action and start to see things like layout.

<h2>Pages</h2>
Pages are a particular type of template. Here, the placeholder content is used to represent the actual content that a user will see.
It contains all the information that is specific to the user requirements.
